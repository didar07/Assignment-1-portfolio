            <h2>Food For A Family</h2>
            <p>Safe food and water supplies are a major concern following a natural disaster such as a tornado, flood,
                hurricane or blizzard. Many families who live in disaster-prone areas may benefit from being prepared in
                the
                event of disaster. Knowing how to safely handle food and water in the immediate few days after the
                disaster
                can reduce stress, worry and inconvenience.</p>

            <h2>Shelter For A Family</h2>
            <p>During flood disaster, people in affected areas seek a safe place to stay. Most people evacuate to
                shelter,
                which is a public safe place usually organized and provided by government. Not only provides a place for
                evacuees, but shelter also works as a distributer to provide necessary supplies for people staying in
                their
                houses in surrounding effected area.</p>

            <h2>Education for a child</h2>
            <p>Education and learning are one of the most important ingredients to becoming all that you can be. How
                open
                you are to learning will help determine your path in life.

                Education does not just happen at school. It is not just about Math and other subjects. Your education
                and
                learning are happening all the time. They happen any time your mind is open to learning.</p>
